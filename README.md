# Hive Fortune Roller 🎲

A slick, modern, and **provably fair** winner selection tool powered by the **Hive Blockchain**. 

Designed for community contests, giveaways, and raffles, this application ensures transparency by using immutable blockchain data to determine winners.

## ✨ Features

- **Provably Fair Algorithm**: Winners are determined using a cryptographic hash of a user-provided "Client Seed" and a real-time "Hive Block Hash".
- **Live Blockchain Integration**: Fetches participants directly from Hive posts (comments) and synchronizes with the latest block data.
- **Bot Filtering**: Automatically excludes known farming bots and spam accounts (customizable blacklist).
- **Flexible Input**: 
  - **Hive Mode**: Load users from any public post URL (e.g., `@author/permlink`).
  - **Manual Mode**: Paste a list of names/entries directly.
- **Modern UI/UX**: 
  - "Harmonic" aesthetic with Indigo/Violet palette.
  - Fully responsive design with Dark/Light mode support.
  - CS:GO-style roller animation with physics-based deceleration.
- **Shareable Proof**: Generates a verified "Victory Card" for the winner with hash details, perfect for social sharing.
- **History & Persistence**: Saves recent winners to local storage.

## 🛡️ How It Works (Provably Fair)

Trust is paramount. Here is the algorithm used to select a winner:

1.  **Inputs**:
    *   **Client Seed**: A random string generated by the browser (or typed by the host) *before* the roll.
    *   **Block Hash**: The `block_id` of the latest block on the Hive blockchain at the moment the "Roll" button is pressed.
2.  **Calculation**:
    *   We concatenate the seeds: `String = ClientSeed + "-" + BlockHash`.
    *   We generate a SHA-256 hash of this string.
    *   We take the first 8 characters (32 bits) of the hex hash and convert it to a decimal (0-1).
3.  **Selection**:
    *   `WinnerIndex = floor(DecimalValue * TotalParticipants)`
    
This process makes it impossible for the host to rig the outcome, as they cannot predict the future Block Hash.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Bot Blacklist
The application includes a curated list of known bot accounts in `src/utils/hive.ts`. You can modify `BOT_BLACKLIST` to add or remove accounts.

### Hive Nodes
RPC nodes are configured in `src/utils/provablyFair.ts`. If the app fails to connect, try updating the `HIVE_NODES` array.
